          <p>
            Due diligence is a process of enquiry and investigation made by a
            prospective buyer in order to confirm that they are buying what they
            think they are buying and fully understand exactly what they are
            buying.
          </p>
          <p>
            The better the due diligence, the more buyers know about a target
            and therefore the more they know about the immediate risks they are
            taking on. Therefore, due diligence allows an acquirer to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Identify issues which feed into price negotiations, and hence
              reduce the risk of paying excessively;
            </li>
            <li>
              Mitigate risk in the deal by identifying areas where legal
              protection ought to be sought.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Due diligence is an aid to working out what contractual protection
            is required from the seller and what risks the buyer should steer
            away from completely.
