              A business plan is a tool that defines a new business, its
              product/ service offerings, its mode of revenue generation,
              management and staffing, financing, operations, and other factors
              crucial for long-term success. Start-ups create them as part of
              the business inception process while existing businesses often
              write them when changing strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
              The business-plan-writing process can also help a start-up
              identify weaknesses, misconceptions, or other details that might
              affect how a business has positioned itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Business plans are usually required by start-ups seeking funding,
              whether from financial institutions or investors. However, since
              they serve as a solid business compass/roadmap, they are
              recommended for all start-ups and entities wishing to revitalize
              existing businesses.
